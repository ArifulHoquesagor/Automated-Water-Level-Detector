# Automated-Water-Level-Detector
This project is a water level detection system that monitors the water level in a tank and transmits the data using a LoRa SX1278 module connected to an ESP8266.
The system is designed to provide accurate water level readings using a stainless steel water level sensor and sends the data to a remote receiver for monitoring.
